 # Newton School Mini Project - 2048
A game of 2048 in JavaScript, HTML and CSS

In this walkthrough, we make the very popular game 2048 in JavaScript, HTML and CSS! No canvas required! (Now with more accurate subtitles for programmers)


## Rules
The game 2048 is played on a 4*4 -square grid with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when the four arrow keys are used to move them . When you slide, a new tile will appear in an empty space on the board at random. Tiles slide as far as they can in the chosen direction before being stopped by another tile or the grid's edge. If two tiles with the same number clash while travelling, they will merge into a single tile with the entire value of the two colliding tiles. In the same move, the resulting tile cannot merge with another tile.
